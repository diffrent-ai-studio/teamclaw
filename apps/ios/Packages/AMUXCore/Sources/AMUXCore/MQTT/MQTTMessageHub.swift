/// Actor-isolated fan-out for inbound MQTT messages.
///
/// `MQTTService` exposes a `messages()` AsyncStream API that yields every
/// incoming MQTT packet to every caller. That worked when there were two
/// consumers, but the app now has TeamclawService, SessionListViewModel,
/// SessionDetailViewModel, ConnectionMonitor, and a dozen RPC awaiters
/// each calling `messages()` and filtering the same stream of payloads.
/// Each consumer pays an extra decode and continuation copy per message.
///
/// The hub consolidates that fan-out: it is the *only* consumer of
/// `MQTTService.messages()` and provides topic-filtered AsyncStreams to
/// every downstream caller. Callers go from "subscribe to all messages,
/// filter by topic in a `guard`" to "subscribe to a topic; receive only
/// matching messages."
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// - `start()` (idempotent) launches the listener task. Call from the
///   composition root on app launch and after every MQTT reconnect.
/// - `stop()` cancels the listener and finishes every downstream filter
///   stream; consumers see their `for await` loop exit cleanly.
///
/// ## Reconnect semantics
///
/// `MQTTService.messages()` finishes its stream on disconnect. The hub's
/// listener loop exits when that happens, and the hub then waits for the
/// MQTTService to report `.connected` again before attaching a fresh
/// upstream stream. Downstream filter streams stay alive across reconnect
/// gaps — consumers do not need to re-subscribe.
