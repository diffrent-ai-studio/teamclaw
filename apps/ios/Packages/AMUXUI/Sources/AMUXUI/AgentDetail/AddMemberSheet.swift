/// Thin wrapper around `MemberListView` that:
///   * hides anyone already in the session (humans + agents) plus the calling user
///   * filters the confirm callback to humans only (agents are added via
///     `AddAgentSheet`, which also configures workspace + agent type)
///
/// Presented from `SessionDetailView` when the user taps "Add member" in the
/// session member sheet. Agents picked here are intentionally dropped — there's
/// no UI to set their workspace/type from this entry point, and we don't want
/// the confusion of half-configured runtimes.
